"""
Optuna example to demonstrate setting the maximum number of trials in
a shared database when multiple workers are used.

In this example, we optimize a simple quadratic function. We use multiple
script runs (workers) to demonstrate the use of max_trial_callbacks,
which allows the user to set a maximum number of trials
regardless of the number of workers/scripts running the Trials.
