Most important enhancements
===========================

Truncate exceptions over grpc (`#468`_)
---------------------------------------
If long error messages where generated in the node side
it could lead to overflow in the grpc side and 
hide the original error from the users. This is now
fixed and error messages are now trunkated to 5 000
characters.
