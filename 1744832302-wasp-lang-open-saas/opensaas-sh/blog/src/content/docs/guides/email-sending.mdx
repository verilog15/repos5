This guide explains how to use the integrated email sender and how you can integrate your own account in this template.

## Sending Emails

### The `Dummy` Email Provider (for Local Dev Only)
By default we've set up the email sender to use the `Dummy` provider. This is **for local development only** and no emails will actually be sent out!
To obtain an email verification token/link, you must check the server logs on initial sign up. You can click this link to verify your email and continue with the sign up process.
```tsx title="main.wasp"
app SaaSTemplate {
  // ...
  emailSender: {
    provider: Dummy,
    defaultFrom: {
      name: "Open SaaS App",
      email: "me@example.com" 
    },
  },
```

Note that your app will not build if using the `Dummy` provider and you must switch to a production-ready provider in order to do so.

### Using a Production-Ready Email Provider (e.g. SendGrid)
To change your email provider to a production-ready one, such as SendGrid, you'll want to configure your `emailSender` like so:

```tsx title="main.wasp"
app SaaSTemplate {
  // ...
  emailSender: {
    provider: SendGrid,
    defaultFrom: {
      name: "Open SaaS App",
      // When using SendGrid, you must use the same email address that you configured your account to send out emails with!
      email: "me@example.com" 
    },
  },
```

This means that you can send emails from your app using the `send` function from the `email` modul provided by Wasp:

```tsx title="src/server/webhooks.ts"
import { emailSender } from "wasp/server/email";

//...

  if (subscription.cancel_at_period_end) {
    await emailSender.send({
      to: customer.email,
      subject: 'We hate to see you go :(',
      text: 'We hate to see you go. Here is a sweet offer...',
      html: 'We hate to see you go. Here is a sweet offer...',
    });
  }
```

In the example above, you can see that we're sending an email to the customer when we receive a cancel subscription event within the Stripe webhook. 

This is a powerful feature and super simple to use.

## Integrate your email sender

To set up your email sender, you first need an account with one of the supported email providers.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="SendGrid">
    - Register at SendGrid.com and then get your [API KEYS](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys).
    - Copy yours to the `.env.server` file under the `SENDGRID_API_KEY` variable. 

    Make sure to change the `defaultFrom` email address in the `main.wasp` file to use the same email address that you configured your account to send out emails with!

    ```tsx title="main.wasp" {5}
    emailSender: {
      provider: SendGrid,
      defaultFrom: {
        name: "Open SaaS App",
        email: "me@example.com" // <--- same email address you configured your SendGrid account to send emails with!
      },
    ``` 
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Mailgun">
    - Go to [Mailgun](https://mailgun.com) and create an account.
    - Go to [API Keys](https://app.mailgun.com/settings/api_security/api_keys?onboardingTask=api-key) and create a new API key.
    - Copy the API key and add it to your .env.server file under the `MAILGUN_API_KEY=` variable.
    - Go to [Domains](https://app.mailgun.com/mg/sending/new-domain?onboardingTask=add-verify-domain) and create a new domain.
    - Copy the domain and add it to your .env.server file as `MAILGUN_DOMAIN=`.

    Make sure to change the `defaultFrom` email address in the `main.wasp` file to use the same email address that you configured your account to send out emails with!

    ```tsx title="main.wasp" {5}
    emailSender: {
      provider: Mailgun,
      defaultFrom: {
        name: "Open SaaS App",
        email: "me@example.com" // <--- same email address you configured your Mailgun account to send emails with!
      },
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
