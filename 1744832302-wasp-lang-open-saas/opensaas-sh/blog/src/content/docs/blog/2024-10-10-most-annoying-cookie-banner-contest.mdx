## What kind of hackathon is this?

The goal here is simple. Make **THE MOST ANNOYING COOKIE BANNER** you can think of.

Cookie consent banners annoy us all. So we thought, why not have some fun with them? Here are a couple examples of what that might look like:

1. *The Cookie Consent Wheel of Fortune:*

<Image src={wheel} alt='Consent wheel' loading='lazy' />

2. *The ‚ÄúHit Enter When the Red Ball is Over the Accept Button to Consent‚Äù Banner:* 
    
<Image src={enter} alt='Enter to win' loading='lazy' />
    

Now it‚Äôs time for you to get creative. Btw, if you‚Äôre looking for some inspiration, check out these [Ridiculous Volume Slider UI‚Äôs](https://uxdesign.cc/the-worst-volume-control-ui-in-the-world-60713dc86950).

## Prizes

2 winners will receive a nice mechanical keyboard, an additional *annoying* gift, as well as a shoutout on our socials.

The 2 winners will be selected by:

- The Wasp team
- Our Community (Discord & Twitter)

The community will get a chance to vote in a battle royale style elimination tournament, where two banners will go head-to-head and the winner will advance to the next round.

(The brand/style will depend on the winner's location, but we'll do our best to find one with a Wasp look and feel üòÉ)
