:::tip[FREE & OPEN-SOURCE!? 🌟]
That's right. Use this template however you like. No strings attached.

If you find this template useful, consider giving us [a star on GitHub](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp). It helps us to keep bringing you open-source software just like this!

## What's inside?

The template itself is built on top of some very powerful tools and frameworks, including:

- 🐝 [Wasp](https://wasp.sh) - a full-stack React, NodeJS, Prisma framework with superpowers
- 🚀 [Astro](https://starlight.astro.build/) - Astro's lightweight "Starlight" template for documentation and blog
- 💸 [Stripe](https://stripe.com) or [Lemon Squeezy](https://lemonsqueezy.com/) - for products and payments
- 📈 [Plausible](https://plausible.io) or [Google](https://analytics.google.com/) Analytics
- 🤖 [OpenAI](https://openai.com) - OpenAI API integrated into the app or [Replicate](https://replicate.com/) (coming soon 👀)
- 📦 [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) - for file uploads
- 📧 [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com), [MailGun](https://mailgun.com), or SMTP - for email sending
- 💅 [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - for styling
- 🧑‍💼 [TailAdmin](https://tailadmin.com/) - admin dashboard & components for TailwindCSS

Because we're using Wasp as the full-stack framework, we can leverage a lot of its features to build our SaaS in record time, including:

- 🔐 [Full-stack Authentication](https://wasp.sh/docs/auth/overview) - Email verified + social Auth in a few lines of code.
- ⛑ [End-to-end Type Safety](https://wasp.sh/docs/data-model/operations/overview) - Type your backend functions and get inferred types on the front-end automatically, without the need to install or configure any third-party libraries. Oh, and type-safe Links, too!
- 🤖 [Jobs](https://wasp.sh/docs/advanced/jobs) - Run cron jobs in the background or set up queues simply by defining a function in the config file.
- 🚀 [One-command Deploy](https://wasp.sh/docs/advanced/deployment/overview) - Easily deploy via the CLI to [Fly.io](https://fly.io), or to other providers like [Railway](https://railway.app) and [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

You also get access to Wasp's diverse, helpful community if you get stuck or need help.
- 🤝 [Wasp Discord](https://discord.gg/rzdnErX)

:::caution["Work In Progress"]
We've tried to get as many of the core features of a SaaS app into this template as possible, but there still might be some missing features or functionality.

We could always use some help tying up loose ends, so consider [contributing](https://github.com/wasp-lang/open-saas/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)!

In the next sections, we'll get our SaaS app started and tour its features. Let's get started!
