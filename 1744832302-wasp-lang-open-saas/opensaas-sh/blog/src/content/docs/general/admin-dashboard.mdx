This is a reference on how the Admin dashboard, available at `/admin`, is set up.

## Permissions

The Admin dashboard is only accessible to users with the `isAdmin` field set to true.

```tsx title="main.wasp" {5}
entity User {=psl
  id                        Int             @id @default(autoincrement())
  email                     String?         @unique
  username                  String?
  isAdmin                   Boolean         @default(false)
  //...
```

To give yourself administrator priveledges, make sure you add your email addresses to the `ADMIN_EMAILS` environment variable in `.env.server` file before registering/logging in with that email address:
```sh title=".env.server"
ADMIN_EMAILS=me@example.com

// or add many admins with a comma-separated list

ADMIN_EMAILS=me@example.com,you@example.com,them@example.com
```

Or if you've already logged in with an email address that you want to give admin priveledges to, you can run the following command in a separate terminal window to update the user's `isAdmin` field manually:

```sh
wasp db studio
```

## Admin Dashboard Pages

### Analytics Dashboard
The Admin analytics dashboard is a single place for you to view your most important metrics and perform some admin tasks. At the moment, it pulls data from:

- [Payments Processor](/guides/payments-integration/):
  - total revenue
  - revenue for each day of the past week
- [Google or Plausible](/guides/analytics/): 
  - total number of page views (non-unique)
  - percentage change in page views from the previous day
  - top sources/referrers with unique visitor count (i.e. how many people came from that source to your app)
- Database:
  - total number of registered users
  - daily change in number of registered users 
  - total number of paying users
  - daily change in number of paying users

These metrics are aggregated within the background job `dailyStatsJob`, which by default is run every hour. You can change the frequency of this job by modifying its `cron` field:

```ts title="main.wasp" {8,7}
job dailyStatsJob {
  executor: PgBoss,
  perform: {
    fn: import { calculateDailyStats } from "@src/analytics/stats"
  },
  schedule: {
    cron: "0 * * * *" // every hour. useful in production
    // cron: "* * * * *" // every minute. useful for debugging
  },
  entities: [User, DailyStats, Logs, PageViewSource]
}
```
For more info on Wasp's recurring background jobs, check out the [Wasp Jobs docs](https://wasp.sh/docs/advanced/jobs).

For a guide on how to integrate these services so that you can view your analytics via the dashboard, check out the [Payments Integration](/guides/payments-integration/) and [Analytics guide](/guides/analytics/) of the docs.
