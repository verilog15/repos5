/**
 * An interface for various Message implementations that can be logged. Messages can act as wrappers
 * around Objects so that user can have control over converting Objects to Strings when necessary without
 * requiring complicated formatters and as a way to manipulate the message based on information available
 * at runtime such as the locale of the system.
 * <p>
 * Custom Message implementations should consider implementing the {@link StringBuilderFormattable}
 * interface for more efficient processing. Garbage-free Layouts will call
 * {@link StringBuilderFormattable#formatTo(StringBuilder) formatTo(StringBuilder)} instead of
 * {@link Message#getFormattedMessage()} if the Message implements StringBuilderFormattable.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: Message objects should not be considered to be thread safe nor should they be assumed to be
 * safely reusable even on the same thread. The logging system may provide information to the Message
 * objects and the Messages might be queued for asynchronous delivery. Thus, any modifications to a
 * Message object by an application should by avoided after the Message has been passed as a parameter on
 * a Logger method.
 * </p>

     * When configured to log asynchronously, this method is called before the Message is queued, unless this
