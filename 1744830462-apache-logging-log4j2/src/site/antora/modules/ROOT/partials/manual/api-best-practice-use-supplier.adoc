If one or more arguments of the log statement are computationally expensive, it is not wise to evaluate them knowing that their results can be discarded.
Consider the following example:

[source,java]
----
/* BAD! */ LOGGER.info("failed for user ID `{}` and role `{}`", userId, db.findUserRoleById(userId));
----

The database query (i.e., `db.findUserNameById(userId)`) can be a significant bottleneck if the created the log event will be discarded anyway â€“ maybe the `INFO` level is not accepted for this logger, or due to some other filtering.

* [ ] The old-school way of solving this problem is to level-guard the log statement:
+
[source,java]
----
/* OKAY */ if (LOGGER.isInfoEnabled()) { LOGGER.info(...); }
----
+
While this would work for cases where the message can be dropped due to insufficient level, this approach is still prone to other filtering cases; e.g., maybe the associated xref:manual/markers.adoc[marker] is not accepted.
* [x] Use ``Supplier``s to pass arguments containing computationally expensive items:
+
[source,java]
----
/* GOOD */ LOGGER.info("failed for user ID `{}` and role `{}`", () -> userId, () -> db.findUserRoleById(userId));
----
* [x] Use a `Supplier` to pass the message and its arguments containing computationally expensive items:
+
[source,java]
----
/* GOOD */ LOGGER.info(() -> new ParameterizedMessage("failed for user ID `{}` and role `{}`", userId, db.findUserRoleById(userId)));
----
