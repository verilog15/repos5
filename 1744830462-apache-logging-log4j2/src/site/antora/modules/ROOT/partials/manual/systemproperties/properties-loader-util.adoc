|===
| Env. variable | `LOG4J_IGNORE_TCL`
| Type          | `boolean`
| Default value | `false`

If `true`, classes are only loaded using the same classloader that loaded Log4j.

Otherwise, an attempt is made to load classes with the current thread's context class loader before falling back to the default class loader.
