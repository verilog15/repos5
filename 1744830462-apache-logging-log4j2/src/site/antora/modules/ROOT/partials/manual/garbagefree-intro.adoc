Garbage collection pauses are a common cause of latency spikes and for many systems significant effort is spent on controlling these pauses.
Log4j allocates temporary `LogEvent`, `String`, `char[]`, `byte[]`, etc. objects during steady state logging.
This contributes to pressure on the garbage collector and increases the frequency with which garbage collection pauses occur.
In _garbage-free mode_, Log4j buffers and reuses objects to lessen this pressure.
