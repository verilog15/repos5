  <description format="asciidoc">MarkerFilter called MarkerManager.getMarker causing the Marker to be created during the processing of the
        configuration. This prevents the application from creating the Marker with any parents. MarkerWrapper in
        SLF4J-impl was getting a ClassCastException in instanceOf because the Marker isn't a MarkerWrapper.</description>
