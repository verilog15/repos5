  <description format="asciidoc">RoutingAppender PurgePolicy implementations no longer stop appenders referenced from the logger configuration,
        only those that have been created by the RoutingAppender. Note that RoutingAppender.getAppenders no longer
        includes entries for referenced appenders, only those which it has created.</description>
