  <description format="asciidoc">Added support for precise (micro and nanosecond) timestamps when running on Java 9. A limited number of precise %d date formats are supported with PatternLayout. POTENTIAL BREAKING CHANGE: The XML, JSON and YAML formats have changed: they no longer have the "timeMillis" attribute and instead have an "Instant" element with "epochSecond" and "nanoOfSecond" attributes.</description>
