  <description format="asciidoc">Changed the (relatively new) PatternLayout configuration attribute "suppressExceptions" to
        "alwaysWriteExceptions" to more correctly indicate what it does. As such, the meaning of this attribute has
        reversed (previous "true"s should become "false"s, and vice versa). Since this was an undocumented attribute up
        until now, it's unlikely this change will affect any users.</description>
